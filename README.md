 <hr />
 The user friendly gui allows users to bypass the challenges of understanding the API and use their own mobile device to fetch from the cowin api.
 <br />
 Instead of relying on third party servers to fetch from the API and inform them, the users have the control in their own hands making this method the fastest.
 <br />
 With an API call every 4 seconds, it notifies users instantly providing them theoretically the fastest and the easiest way to search for a vaccination slot.
